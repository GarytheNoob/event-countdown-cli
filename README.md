```

### Configuration

cliMatter can be configured using a local configuration file. By default, it
looks for a user configuration file at `~/.config/climatter/config.yaml`. You
can also specify a custom configuration file using the `--config` option.

The default configuration file is located at `./climatter/default_config/config.yaml`
in the project directory. You can copy this file to your user configuration path
and modify it as needed.

### Event List File

You need to create a local event list file in the following format:

```
# Comments take whole lines and begin with '#'
# Each line represents an event in the format:
# For a one-time event:
# YYYY-MM-DD;;Event Title
# For a recurring annual event:
# MM-DD;;Event Title
# Example:

01-01;;New Year's Day
12-25;;Christmas
1990-07-15;;John's Birthday
```
